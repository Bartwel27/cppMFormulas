## 2D shapes
**_Square function_**

*Formula*
> A = S²

The square function is a function that need a side as its only parameter and returns the Area of a shape when multiplied by its own value and returns the area as in double data type
```
square(3.20); 
```

**_Rectangle function_**

*formula*
> A = bh

The rectangle function is that accepts 2 parameters wich are base and height and returns the Area of a shape when passed
``` 
rectangle(36,2);
```
```parallelogram(2,2); A = bh```
```trapezoid(2,3,3); A = (a+b)h/2```
```triangle(2,4); A = 1 / 2 * bh```
```circle(3); A = πr^2```
```ellipes(2,2); A = πab```

`#222`
